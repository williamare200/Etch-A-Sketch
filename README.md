# Etch-A-Sketch

### Create a webage with 16x16 grid of square divs using flexbox
### Set up a "hover" effect so that grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would
### Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number fo squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before(e.g 960px wide) so that you've got a new sketch pad
